# Social-media-auto-poster

This is an interesting PHP script that can be used to create social media campaigns, schedule them and auto post to your desired account. Currently it can only auto post to facebook, twitter and youtube . I NEED DEVELOPERS TO ADD MORE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS especially instagram and google plus. May you also make it possible to auto post to wordpress. There is membership module in this script and admin can restrict any social media channels and features from used according to user's current plan, I ALSO NEED THAT RULES TO BE ADDED  TO  THOSE SOCIAL MEDIA CHANNELS. 

I also need the following functions 
1. Option for admin to enter a message that will appear to users dashboard 
2. Possibility to customize the site appearance/design 
3. Possibility to add  link shortening services
4. Improve/ add more features to image editor
5. Ability for users and admin to contact each other through the dashboard 
6. Admin should receive an email when a new user sign up 
7. Option to send all users emails at once (inside admin dashboard)
8. option to customize the email that is sent to a new user when they sign up 
9. Option to approve/disapprove a new user when they sign up 
10, Ability for user to create account/login through facebook, twitter and google plus 

You can add more features to make it more powerful like hootsuite.com and dlvr.it
